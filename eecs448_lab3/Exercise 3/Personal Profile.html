            Hi my name is Meg and I am 21 years old. I am a Kappa Delta studying computer science. (Yes you can be in engineering 
            and be in a sorority!) Outside of univeristy I love art, travel, watching Friends, and going on adventures with fun people. 
            Some fun facts about me are:<br>I am a twin<br>I have been to 22 countries<br>I am a Pisces<br> During this quarantine I have been
            keeping busy with my course work (21 credit hours does not leave me with much free time). I wish my junior year did not come 
            to an abrupt end but I am hopeful that my senior year will go off without a hitch. 
        </p>
